This Application converts Brazilian Real (BRL) to BTC, MilliBTC, MicroBTC, and SatohiBTC.
It was done in Kotlin, it was published ad Play Store as https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.javacafe.satoshirealconverter

The code is available to be used and modified. But be aware that I just started learning Androind and Kotlin.
